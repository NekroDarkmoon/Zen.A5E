		"description": "<p>In addition to its use as a spellcasting focus, a staff can also be used as a quarterstaff.</p><p><strong><em>Arcane Focus:</em></strong> These foci are soaked in arcane power and often engraved or painted with eldritch symbols and cosmic iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires, staves, or wands are often used as spellcasting foci by sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards.</p><p><strong><em>Divine Focus:</em></strong> These foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon, or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci by clerics and heralds.</p><p><strong><em>Nature Focus:</em></strong> These foci typically incorporate furs, feathers, living plants, sacred wood, or the bones or teeth of sacred animals. Staves, wands, wonders, fetishes, or totems are typically used as spellcasting foci by druids and rangers.</p>",
