When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the spirit you call forth to be an aberration, elemental, or undead.</p>\n<p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Additionally, when you use Eldritch Scythe, you can choose to deliver the attack through your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range of Touch.</p>",
