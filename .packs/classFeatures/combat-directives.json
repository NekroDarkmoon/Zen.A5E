You learn one additional combat maneuver from the Sanguine Knot tradition. This combat maneuver does not count against the number of combat maneuvers that you know.</p><p>In addition, when a creature uses your Commanding Presence to make an attack, it can simultaneously use one Sanguine Knot combat maneuver that you know. If the creature does not have any exertion points to spend on combat maneuvers, it does not require exertion points for that use but it cannot benefit from Combat Directives again until it has finished a short or long rest.</p>",
