The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Choose fire damage or necrotic damage. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional [[/r 1d4]] damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>Your patron siphons the cursed creature’s life force and pays you a dividend. When the cursed creature dies, you regain hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1). </p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
