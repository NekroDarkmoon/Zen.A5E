Choose one of the following:</p><h3><strong>Traditional Spells</strong></h3><p>Your circle has practiced and perfected several spells that you have memorized by rote. When you first gain this feature, select 3 spells from the Air, Beasts, Earth, Healing, Nature, Plants, Terrain, Water, or Weather schools as your traditional spells. </p><p>You may select up to two additional traditional spells from those schools at your 7th, 9th, and 11th druid levels. You always have your traditional spells prepared and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. </p><p>If you select a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is a druid spell for you.</p>",
