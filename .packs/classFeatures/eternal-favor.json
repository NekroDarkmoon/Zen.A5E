This commonly takes the place of a gold medal, but it can be any other trinket of similar size. While you are wearing the item, you are immune to the blinded, deafened, fatigue, and poisoned conditions. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion to use your Blessed Prowess feature on any ability check and you donâ€™t need to spend exertion to call upon Sacred Boons. Finally, when you roll initiative and are wearing your Eternal Favor, you roll your martial arts die and regain that much exertion.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If your Eternal Favor is destroyed, the gods bestow another token upon you after you complete an arduous task to prove you are still worthy.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">[[/r 1d4 #d4 die]] [[/r 1d6 #d6 die]] [[/r 1d8 #d8 die]] [[/r 1d10 #d10 die]] [[/r 1d12 #d12 die]]</p>",
