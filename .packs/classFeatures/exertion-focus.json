		"description": "<p>At 2nd level, your training allows you to harness your mental energy into a supernatural state of focus. Some cultures refer to this energy as axé, prana, pneuma, or ki. Your access to this energy is represented by your exertion pool. You can spend exertion points to fuel various focus features.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Long Step, and Patient Defense. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Focus save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"></p><h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Flurry of Blows</strong></h4><h4 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long Step</strong></h4><h4 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient Defense</strong></h4><p style=\"text-align: start\"></p>",
