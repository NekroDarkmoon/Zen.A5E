Each creature makes a Charisma saving throw or takes [[/r 5d10 #force]] force damage and [[ /r 5d10 #necrotic]] necrotic damage, or half damage on a success.</p><p>When you use this feature, you also choose one of the following conditions: blinded, confused, deafened, frightened, poisoned, rattled, or slowed. A creature that failed its saving throw also gains the chosen condition. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself.</p><p>In addition, you can choose any number of creatures you can see that have the Evil alignment trait. Each regains [[/r 5d10 #hit points]] hit points.</p>",
