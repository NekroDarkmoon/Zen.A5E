When you finish a short or long rest, you can choose a benefit from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use that benefit.</p><p>When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can change your benefit to a different one, recharging your Flux. Otherwise your Flux recharges when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><strong><em>Reactive Ward</em></strong>. When you make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the result. You may do so after the roll is made, but before any effects of it are resolved.</p>",
