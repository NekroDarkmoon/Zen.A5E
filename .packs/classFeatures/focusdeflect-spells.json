When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your adept level.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 exertion to redirect the spell to another target within 30 feet of you as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency using your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
