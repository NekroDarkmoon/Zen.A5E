As long as a creature is grappled by your lasso, it is also restrained. The lasso has AC 13 and 7 hit points. It is vulnerable to slashing damage and resistant to bludgeoning damage. If the lasso drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p></li><li><p>When you use the Attack action and attack with a dual-wielding weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a net or use a lasso you are holding.</p></li></ul>",
