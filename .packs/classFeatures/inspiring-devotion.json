Once you have used this feature you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.</em></p><p><strong>Reveal Heresy</strong><em> You gain proficiency in the Insight skill, and gain an expertise die on to Insight checks. Whenever a creature is lying to you, it makes a Charisma saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Insight score. This save is made with disadvantage and done in secret by the Narrator.
