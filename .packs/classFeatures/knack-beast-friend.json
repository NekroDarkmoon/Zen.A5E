It follows you and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast wonâ€™t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal and makes death saving throws. You can only be a guardian ranger to one beast at a time.</p><p><br></p>",
