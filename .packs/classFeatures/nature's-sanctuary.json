		"description": "<p>At 7th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant attacks you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your herald spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The beast or plant has advantage on this saving throw if it has a CR equal to or higher than your herald level. A creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. </p><p>In addition, you canâ€™t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey.</p>",
