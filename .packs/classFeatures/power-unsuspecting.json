When you fail on a Deception check against a humanoid, you can use a combination of fasttalk and your magic to make them forget your misstep, spending 1 sorcery point to reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in the gap with your new story. On a failure, not only do they not believe you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including your target, if applicable) knows that arcane subterfuge was attempted.</p>",
