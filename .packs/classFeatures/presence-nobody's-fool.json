In addition, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an action to project an aura of honesty. For the next 10 minutes, creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on Deception checks made to lie or conceal the truth. When a creature in this aura fails a Deception check, it accidentally blurts out something it didn’t mean to while attempting to spin its lie.</p>",
