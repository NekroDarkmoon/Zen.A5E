		"description": "<p>You have a way with creatures wildly unlike yourself. Select three of the following creature types: aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. You have advantage on Charisma checks to make a first impression on a creature of one of your chosen types, and if you do not share a common language, you can still communicate some simple concepts to them&nbsp;such as “friendly”, “help”, and “run”. In addition, by spending 2 sorcery points and 1 minute in meditation, you can change your creature type to one of the chosen creature types. This transformation lasts for 1 hour, and cannot be reversed early without repeating the meditation and spending the sorcery points again.</p>",
