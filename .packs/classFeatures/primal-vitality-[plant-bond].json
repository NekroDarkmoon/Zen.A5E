		"description": "<p>At 6th level your outpouring of natural power begins manifesting in new ways. </p><h3><strong>Plant Bond</strong></h3><p>You have a mystic connection with flora. As an action you can expend 2 uses of Wild Shape to summon a plant creature with a CR no greater than 1/3 your druid level in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Plants summoned in this way are allied to you and your companions. While plants summoned in this way are within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command them. When you command multiple plants in this way, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the plant takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, a summoned plant only defends itself. Plants you summon in this way remain for up to 8 hours, or until killed or magically dismissed as a bonus action.</p>",
