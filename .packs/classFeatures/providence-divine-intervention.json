Describe the assistance you seek and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The Narrator chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric archetype spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you canâ€™t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p><p>After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the number required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets to your cleric level or below.</p><p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>",
