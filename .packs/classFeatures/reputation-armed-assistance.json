As part of their hospitality they feed you and your companions, and provide a safe place to sleep, as well as offer to trade information and word of any jobs your group may be interested in. When these meetings go particularly well they might offer more tangible help in the form&nbsp;of scouting the area around a monsterâ€™s den or distracting a group of bandits to give you an edge.</p>",
