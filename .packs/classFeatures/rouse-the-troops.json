Each friendly creature that can hear or understand you can spend any number of hit dice to regain hit points without having to finish a short rest. In addition, each creature that does spend at least one Hit Die in this way can remove one level of fatigue or strife it is suffering from. Once a creature has removed a level of fatigue or strife from your use of this class feature, the creature must finish a long rest before it can do so again.</p>",
