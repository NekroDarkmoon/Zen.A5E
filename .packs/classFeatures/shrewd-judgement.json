For the next 24 hours, you have advantage on Insight checks made against the target.</p><h3><strong>Tricky Interrogation</strong></h3><p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you ask a yes or no question to a creature you can see, you can make a Deception check opposed by the target’s Deception check.
