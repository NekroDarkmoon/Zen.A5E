Once per turn, you can deal extra weapon damage when you hit a creature with a finesse weapon or ranged weapon attack. The amount of extra damage is shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. </p><p>In order to apply this damage, you must not have disadvantage on the attack and your target must be within 5 feet of another enemy of the target who is not incapacitated. Alternatively, you can apply sneak attack damage if you have advantage on the attack.</p>",
