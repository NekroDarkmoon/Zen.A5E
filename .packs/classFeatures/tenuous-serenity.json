When you make a Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add an expertise die to the roll, or reroll an expertise die used in the roll. You may do this after seeing the result.</p><p>Additionally, you can spend time in meditation to attempt to reclaim magics you’ve lost. When you finish a short rest, select a spell that’s been removed from your spell list by one of your class features. You reclaim the spell. You can’t perform this meditation again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
