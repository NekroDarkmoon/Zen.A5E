When you finish a long rest, you may replace your flair with another.</p><p>Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair. You can do so again when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3><strong>Terror</strong></h3><p>Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, it starts its turn by using its full movement to get away from you in the most direct manner possible, avoiding obvious hazards along the way.</p>",
