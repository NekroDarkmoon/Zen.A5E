		"description": "<p>This seemingly empty cloth bag comes in several colors and has a small, fuzzy object inside.</p><p>You can use an action to pull a fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. Upon landing, it becomes a creature determined by a roll on the Bag of Tricks table (depending on the bag’s color).</p><p>The resulting creature is friendly to you and any companions you have. It acts on your turn, during which you can use a bonus action to give it simple commands such as “attack that creature” or “move over there”. If the creature dies or if you use the bag again, it disappears without a trace. After the first use each day, there is a 50% chance that a creature from the bag is hostile instead of friendly and obedient.</p><p>Once you have used the bag three times, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Table: Blue Bag of Tricks (d8)</strong></p><p>1 - Quipper</p><p>2 - Octopus</p><p>3 - Seahorse</p><p>4 - Hunter Shark</p><p>5 - Swarm of quippers</p><p>6 - Reef shark</p><p>7 - Giant Seahorse</p><p>8 - Giant Octopus</p>",
