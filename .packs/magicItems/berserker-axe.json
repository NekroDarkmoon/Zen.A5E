		"description": "<p>You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic axe, and while you are attuned to it your hit point maximum is increased by 1 for each level you have attained. </p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> After you attune to this axe you are unwilling to part with it, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one unless the nearest foe you are aware of is 60 feet or more away from you.</p><p>In addition, when you are damaged by a hostile creature you make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, on your turn each round you move to the nearest creature and take the Attack action against it, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you incapacitate your current target. When there is more than one possible target, you randomly determine which to attack. You continue to be berserk until there are no creatures you can see or hear within 60 feet of you at the start of your turn.</p>",
