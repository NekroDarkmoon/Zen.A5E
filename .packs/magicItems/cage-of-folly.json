		"description": "<p>This small silver or gold birdcage traps your bad ideas and puts them on display. When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, a little piece of a mechanical bird materializes inside the cage: first the feet, then legs, body, wings, and head. You can immediately reconsider and reroll the ability check. The <em>cage of folly</em> can be used once every 24 hours, and recharges at the end of each week.</p><p>Once you have used the birdcage 5 times, the bird sings a mocking song for 1 hour when you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check. If you open the birdcage and let the bird go free, it gives you one piece of good advice about a current problem or question that you face. At the Narratorâ€™s discretion, the advice may give you advantage on one ability check made in the next week. Afterward it flies away as the birdcage loses its magic and becomes a mundane item (though some who have released their birds claim to have encountered them again in the wilds later.)</p>",
