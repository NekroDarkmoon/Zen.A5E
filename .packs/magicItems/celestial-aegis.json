While attuned to and wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits: </p><p>• Your AC increases by 2. </p><p>• You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity. </p><p>• Your Strength score increases to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20. </p><p>• You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. </p><p>• You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. </p><p>• You can use a bonus action to regain 2d6 hit points. Once you have used this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. </p><p>• Your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage. </p><p>• Aberrations, fiends, undead, and creatures with the Evil alignment trait have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you.</p>",
