		"description": "<p>A circular disk of dozens of interlocking gears almost a foot in diameter, upon first examination this device is unfathomably complex. The gears are covered with runes that appear to be a much older form of Dwarvish script. Rotating some of the raised gears causes this apparatus to slowly tick through a series of symbols that seem to correspond to astrological signs. </p><p>To understand how to operate the <em>clockwork calendar</em>, you must carefully study the device and turn the gears through their myriad configurations. After 1 hour you can make a DC 16 Investigation or Arcana check. On a failure, you cannot reach a conclusion regarding how to interpret the intended function of the calendar. On a success, you understand how to utilize the device as indicated below. Casting <em>identify</em> on the calendar reveals a moderate aura of divination magic but provides no information on how to use this complex object. </p><p>Once you know how the <em>clockwork calendar</em> functions, you can adjust the dials to display the current day of the year for the geographical region of the world you are located in (this property does not function outside of the Material Plane). The exposed faces of the gears composing the calendar display the position of the stars in the sky and the dials can be adjusted throughout the day or night to continue to track their position. The calendar can also be adjusted to any past or future dates and times to ascertain the position of any of the celestial objects visible in the night sky. </p><p>Additionally, you can use a bonus action to smash the <em>clockwork calendar</em> and destroy it, gaining the benefits of the <em>haste</em> spell until the end of your next turn.</p>",
