		"description": "<p>This box houses a set of 34 illustrated cards when new. A found deck is typically missing 1d20 cards. </p><p>As an action, you can draw a random card (one manually selected does nothing) and throw it up to 30 feet from you. </p><p>Upon landing, the card creates an illusion of one or more creatures. These illusions are of normal size for the creatures depicted and act normally, but are insubstantial and harmless. While you are within 120 feet of the illusion, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 30 feet from its card. </p><p>The illusions are revealed to a creature when it uses an action to make a DC 15 Investigation check or automatically upon any physical interaction. Once revealed, an illusion becomes translucent. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or it is dispelled. In either case the card disappears and cannot be reused. </p>",
