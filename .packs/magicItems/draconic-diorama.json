		"description": "<p>This Tiny diorama is contained within a cube-shaped box 5 inches on each side. The bottom is lead and the rest made of transparent crystal. Inside the box there are several trees made of paper and wire, a treasure chest made of clay, and a 1 1/2-inch dragon skeleton. The skeleton stands in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move while being observed. </p><p>While you carry the diorama, you have advantage on saving throws against Frightful Presence. </p><p>A successful DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box. </p><p><em>Curse.</em> While carrying the cursed diorama you are compelled to amass more wealth. As long as you are compelled, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to willingly part with the diorama, even temporarily.</p>",
