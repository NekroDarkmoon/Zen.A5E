When in need of advice, you can open the leather-bound tome and spend 1 minute looking for a similar situation.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><blockquote><p><strong><em>Roll a d10:</em></strong></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>7-10</strong>: you learn one fact relevant to the situation.</p></li><li><p><strong>1-6</strong>: you instead learn one fact or piece of advice that is irrelevant to the situation (such as “<em>a group of tigers is called an ambush</em>,” or “<em>you should eat more leafy greens</em>”).</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to rapidly find one tale of questing relevant to your situation and rip it out of the book.</p><blockquote><p><em>Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material components.</em></p></blockquote><p>After a page is torn from the tome in this way, it becomes a mundane scrapbook.</p>",
