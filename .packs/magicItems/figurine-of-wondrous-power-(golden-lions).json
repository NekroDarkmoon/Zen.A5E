		"description": "<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>These gold lion figurines are always created in pairs, but can be used both together or separately.</p><p>Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour, after which it can’t be used for 7 days.</p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>LION</strong> (CHALLENGE 1)</p><p>LARGE BEAST (200 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 30 (4d10+8; bloodied 15)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 50 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>16 </strong>(+3) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>3 </strong>(–4) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>4 </strong>(–3)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 13</p><p><strong>Skills</strong> Perception +3, Stealth +4</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 13</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: —</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Keen Smell.</em></strong> The lion has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Long Jump.</em></strong> The lion can long jump up to 25 feet.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Pack Tactics.</em></strong> The lion has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the lion’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and not incapacitated.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p style=\"text-align: start\"><em>ACTIONS</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Claws<em>.</em></strong><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage.
