Creatures within the area make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or are poisoned by the potent alcohol. At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned by the flask can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The flask has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the flask loses its potency and becomes a mundane item.</p>",
