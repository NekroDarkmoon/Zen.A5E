		"description": "<p>Though glass is expensive and not found in all buildings, breaking a window is a common aspect of burglaryâ€”a dangerous part if there are guards to worry about.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to make the hand and arm wearing the ring pass through a single pane of glass for for 2d4 + 2 rounds. Objects that you hold in that hand also pass through the glass.</p><p>If your hand or arm are still through the glass at the end of the duration, you take 1d10 slashing damage as the glass breaks.</p><p>Alternatively, when you hit a creature made of glass or crystal with a melee attack using the hand wearing the ring, you can command the ring to shatter. The hit deals an additional 2d8 damage.</p><p>The ring has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the ring loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>",
