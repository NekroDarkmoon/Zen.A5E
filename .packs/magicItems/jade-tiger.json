When you attune to the item and keep it on your person, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made to find and follow tracks for up to 1 hour per day.</p><p>When you speak the jade tiger’s command word, you vividly recall one of the weretiger’s most challenging hunts. For the next minute, you can use a bonus action to make a Stealth check to hide immediately before or after you take the Attack action. The jade tiger’s magic forever fades away after being used in this way.</p>",
