		"description": "<p>This salty chewing gum is made from the sap of a deep sea plant and is normally stored inside of a clamshell. In order to activate it, you must chew the gum as an action, during which its properties are released into your bloodstream. The center of your forehead forms a slight bump and begins to glow. Any darkness within a range of 120 feet becomes dim light, and any dim light within the same range becomes bright light. The gum has no effect on bright light.</p><p>The effect lasts for 1 hour, after which the gum loses its magical properties. The gum itself is a bit of an acquired taste and when you chew it for the first time you must make a DC 10 Constitution check or gain the stunned condition for a round as you vomit. Vomited gum can be retrieved and used again, but its remaining duration is halved every time it is reused.</p><p>Luminescent gum is generally found in bunches of 6 or 12 clamshells.</p>",
