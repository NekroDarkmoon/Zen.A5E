Magic mirrors can be found in three sizes.</p><p><br>While this bulky mirror is securely fastened to a wall, twice per dawn you<br>can look into it and speak a command phrase to cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.2pfctui1i2tl0rgf]{Commune}, @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.lxdkhrfvq3e2l12j]{Contact Other Plane}, or @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.mi8pwwl5pdcvdz1t]{Divination}. Your reflection answers your questions. Additionally, as an action once per dawn, the wall mirror can be linked to another magic mirror by speaking the name of the other mirror’s bearer,<br>initiating a face to face conversation that can last up to 10 minutes. Both you and the other mirror user can clearly see each other’s faces, but don’t get any sense of one another’s surroundings. Either you or the other mirror user can use a bonus action to end the conversation early. <br><br></p>",
