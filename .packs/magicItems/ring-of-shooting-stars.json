The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges at dawn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Faerie Fire.</em></strong> You can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast <em>faerie fire</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Ball Lightning.</em></strong> You can use an action and expend 2 charges to create up to four 3-foot-diameter lightning spheres. The number of spheres created determines each sphere’s intensity (see Table: Ball Lightning below), each sheds light in a 30-foot radius, and they remain up to 1 minute as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell). As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no further than 120 feet from you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and then disappears. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or takes lightning damage based on the sphere’s intensity.</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spheres - Lightning damage</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center\">1 - [[/r 4d12]]<br>2 -   [[/r 5d4]]<br>3 -   [[/r 2d6]]<br>4 -   [[/r 2d4]]</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Shooting Stars.</em></strong> You can use an action to expend 1 to 3 charges. For each expended charge, you shoot a glittering mote of light at a point you can see within 60 feet where it explodes in a 15-foot-cube of sparks. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 5d4 #fire]] fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.</p>",
