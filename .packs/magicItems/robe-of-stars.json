You remain there until you use an action to return, appearing either in the space you last occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.<br>• Up to 6 times each day, you can use an action to pull a star from the robe to cast <em>magic missile</em> (as a 5th-level spell). </p><p>At dusk [[/r 1d6 #stars]] removed stars reappear.</p>",
