This rod can magically store up to 200 Supply. While holding the rod you can use an action to target up to 20 Supply you can see within 5 feet of you, which instantly vanishes and is stored in the rod. You can’t use this ability in paradise.</p><p>A newly found rod has [[/r 2d100 #Supply stored]] Supply already stored.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Paradise</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to activate it and expend an amount of Supply (1 per creature) for yourself and each willing creature you can see. You and the other creatures are instantly transported into an extraplanar haven that takes the form of any paradise you can imagine (or chosen at random using the Sample Paradises table). It contains enough Supply to sustain its visitors, and for each hour spent in paradise a visitor regains 10 hit points. Creatures don’t age while in paradise, although time passes normally. To maintain the extraplanar space each day beyond the first, an amount of Supply equal to the number of visitors must be expended from the rod.</p><p>Apart from visitors and the objects they brought into the paradise, everything within the paradise can only exist there. A cushion taken from a palace paradise, for example, disappears when taken outside.</p><p>When you expend the last Supply stored in the rod or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or the nearest unoccupied space, and the rod can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Sample paradises</strong></p><p><strong>[[/r 1d6]] - Paradise</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong> Cloud castle<br><strong>2 </strong>Cozy tavern<br><strong>3 </strong>Fantastic carnival<br><strong>4 </strong>Luxurious palace<br><strong>5 </strong>Tranquil glade<br><strong>6 </strong>Tropical island</p><p><br><br></p>",
