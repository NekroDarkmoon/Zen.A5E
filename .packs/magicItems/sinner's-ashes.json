		"description": "<p>This small stark urn contains the ashen remains of an unholy humanoid.</p><p>As an action, you can throw the urn up to 30 feet away where it shatters and produces a 20-foot radius black cloud of ash. This area is heavily obscured and any creature that ends its turn within the area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage. This ash cloud remains for 1 minute, until a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, or until a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.</p><p>Alternatively, the ashes can be used as an ingestible poison. The urn contains enough ashes for a single dose, and any celestial that consumes them must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
