On a hit, you deal 1 magical piercing damage and the creature makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls into a magical slumber (as the sleep spell) for 2d4 hours. A sleeping creature awakens when it takes damage or a loud noise occurs within 50 feet of it.</p><p>This enchanted slumber is infectious through touch. When a creature uses an action to try and shake or slap a sleeper awake, it makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls asleep for 1d4 hours.</p><p>The needle breaks when you roll a 1 on a weapon attack roll using it, dispersing its sleep magic in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it falls asleep.</p>",
