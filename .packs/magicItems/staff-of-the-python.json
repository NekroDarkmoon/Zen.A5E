The snake acts immediately after you. You decide its moves and actions, or you can issue a general command such as to guard a location.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can transform the snake back into a staff by repeating the command word. The staff appears in the space formerly occupied by the snake.</p><p>If the snake has at least 1 hit point when it becomes a staff, it regains all its hit points. If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to staff form before shattering into pieces.</p>",
