Whenever the creature is damaged by its wound, it can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending all wound effects it is suffering from on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, the wounds can be healed if the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) uses an action to make a DC 15 Medicine check, ending all wound effects it is suffering from on a success.</p><p>Damage dealt by this sword can only be regained by taking a short or long restâ€” no other method, magical or otherwise, will restore the hit points.</p>",
