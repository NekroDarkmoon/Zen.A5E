		"description": "<p>The stresses of a wizard’s education can overwhelm even the most stalwart apprentices without some sort of diversion.</p><p>Typically resembling a small, worn book with fanciful creatures or locales on battered leather covers, the tome’s pages fill with serialized stories that engage and distract the reader. Each tome focuses on a given genre (often romance or adventure) but the stories crafted within the pages are unique to each reader, tailored by the magic from their own imagination and so vibrant that the book’s tales seem to come to life in the mind’s eye.</p><p>Each tome has 3 charges.</p><p>When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, its pages fill with a serial story tailored to the next reader that touches the tome.</p><p>This story typically takes 1 hour to read, continuing from where the last tale completed.</p><p>When you speak another command word and use an action to expend all 3 charges, the story created when the book is opened is particularly engrossing and the reader must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be enthralled, failing to notice anything that is not directly harmful.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>The tome has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the tome loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>",
