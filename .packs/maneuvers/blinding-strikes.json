Until the start of your next turn, when you use a melee weapon to deal damage against a creature, it is blinded and can't benefit from either blindsight or tremorsense.</p><p>At the beginning of each of its turns, a creature blinded by this maneuver can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>",
