On a failure, it reacts to a strike from you that never comes. As long as you remain within the target's reach, until the start of your next turn it cannot attack any creature other than you.</p><p>After you have used this maneuver against a creature, until the end of combat it has advantage on saving throws against Force Hesitation.</p>",
