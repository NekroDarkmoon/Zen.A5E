		"description": "<p>You can use the Shove maneuver to push a creature away. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.</p><p>The target must be within your reach and be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and push the target a number of feet away from you equal to 5 + 5 for every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. You can move the creature in any direction away from you (to the side, forward, or diagonally away).</p><p>A creature that is shoved off of a precipice is propelled off of whatever it is standing on -- it does not receive any saving throw or ability check to grab onto something to avoid falling down below.</p>",
