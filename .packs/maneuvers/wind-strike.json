You can use the chosen weapon to strike a distant target with air pressure, giving your attack a normal range of 20 feet and long range of 60 feet. This functions as if your weapon had the thrown property except you don't actually throw it.</p><p>You have advantage on attack rolls made using this maneuver. If both attack rolls hit, you deal an additional weapon damage die.</p><p>After using this maneuver to hit a creature, it can use an action to make a Perception check against your maneuver DC. On a success, for the next minute any uses of Wind Strike do not grant advantage on attack rolls made against the creature.</p>",
