If you hit with your next attack roll using the chosen weapon against a living creature, you deliver a wound that deals 1d4 ongoing damage (page 448).</p><p>At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC, ending the ongoing damage on a success.</p><p>Healing magically or from a trait (such as Regeneration) also ends the effect.</p>",
