		"description": "<p>A cloud of burning embers, smoke, and roiling flame appears within range. The cloud heavily obscures its area, spreading around corners and through cracks. When the cloud appears and a creature is in it, when a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or when a creature ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p><p>The cloud can be dispelled by a wind of at least 10 miles per hour. After it is cast, the cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Clinging Incendiary Cloud.</strong> Until the spell ends, burning embers stick to any creatures caught within the cloud. A creature that fails a saving throw against the spell takes 1d8 ongoing fire damage. A creature outside of the cloud can use an action to brush the embers off.</p>",
