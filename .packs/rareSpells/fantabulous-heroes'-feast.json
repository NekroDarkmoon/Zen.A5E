Consuming the food takes 1 hour and leaves a creature feeling nourished—it immediately makes a saving throw with advantage against any disease or poison it is suffering from, and it is cured of any effect that frightens it.</p><p>For up to 24 hours afterward the feast's participants have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, advantage on saving throws made against disease and poison, resistance against damage from poison and disease, and each increases its hit point maximum by 2d10.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Fantabulous Heroes’ Feast.</strong> For 24 hours afterward, you gain advantage on Charisma checks made against creatures that participate in the feast.</p>",
