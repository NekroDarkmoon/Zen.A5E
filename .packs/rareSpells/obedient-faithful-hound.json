Until the spell ends, the hound remains in the area unless you spend an action to dismiss it or you move more than 100 feet away from it.</p><p>The hound is invisible except to you and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature enters the area without speaking a password you specify when casting the spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures, can see into the Ethereal Plane, and is immune to illusions.</p><p>At the start of each of your turns, the hound makes a bite attack against a hostile creature of your choice that is within the area, using your spell attack bonus and dealing 4d8 piercing damage on a hit.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Obedient Faithful Hound.</strong> You can use a bonus action to move the area up to 30 feet. You may do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, after which you cannot move the area any more for this casting of the spell. </p>",
