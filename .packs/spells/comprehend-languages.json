Typically interpreting an unknown language is a DC 20 check, but the Narrator may use DC 15 for a language closely related to one you know, DC 25 for a language that is particularly unfamiliar or ancient, or DC 30 for a lost or dead language. This spell doesn't uncover secret messages or decode cyphers, and it does not assist in uncovering lies.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The bonus increases by +5 for each slot level above 1st.</p>",
