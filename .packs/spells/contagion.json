On a hit, you afflict the target with a disease chosen from the list below.</p><p>The target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. After three failed saves, the disease lasts for the duration and the creature stops making saves, or after three successful saves, the creature recovers and the spell ends. A greater restoration spell or similar effect also ends the disease.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Blinding Sickness:</strong> The target's eyes turn milky white. It is blinded and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws.</p></li><li><p><strong>Filth Fever:</strong> The target is wracked by fever. It has disadvantage when using Strength for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flesh Rot:</strong> The target's flesh rots. It has disadvantage on Charisma ability checks and becomes vulnerable to all damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mindfire:</strong> The target hallucinates. During combat it is confused, and it has disadvantage when using Intelligence for an ability check or saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rattling Cough:</strong> The target becomes discombobulated as it hacks with body-wracking coughs.
