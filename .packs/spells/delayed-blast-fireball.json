Each creature in the area takes 12d6 fire damage. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.</p><p>If touched before the spell ends, the creature touching the bead makes a Dexterity saving throw or the bead detonates. On a successful save, the creature can use an action to throw the bead up to 40 feet, moving the area with it. If the bead strikes a creature or solid object, the bead detonates.</p><p>The fire spreads around corners, and it damages and ignites any flammable unattended objects in the area.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>",
