Its size doubles in all dimensions and its weight increases eightfold. The target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

The target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws and its weapons shrink, dealing 1d4 less damage (its attacks deal a minimum of 1 damage).</li></ul></p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a spell slot of 4th-level, you can cause the target and its gear to increase by two size categories&mdash;from Medium to Huge, for example.
