As a bonus action you may command the target to open, close, lock, or unlock any nonmagical doors or windows, or to thrash about and attempt to crush its inhabitants. While the target is thrashing, any creature inside or within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. When the spell ends, the target returns to its previous state, magically repairing any damage it sustained during the spell's duration.</p>",
