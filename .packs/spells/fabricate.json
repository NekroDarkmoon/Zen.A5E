    "description": "<p>You convert raw materials into finished items of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a pitcher from a lump of clay, a bridge from a pile of lumber or group of trees, or rope from a patch of hemp.</p><p>When you cast the spell, select raw materials you can see within range. From them, the spell fabricates a Large or smaller object (contained within a single 10-foot cube or up to eight connected 5-foot cubes) given a sufficient quantity of raw material. When fabricating with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of any objects made with the spell is equivalent to the quality of the raw materials.</p><p>Creatures or magic items can't be created or used as materials with this spell. It also may not be used to create items that require highly-specialized craftsmanship such as armor, weapons, clockworks, glass, or jewelry unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools needed to craft such objects.</p>",
