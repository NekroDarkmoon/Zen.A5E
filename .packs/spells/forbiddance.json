Creatures can't teleport into the area, use a magical portal to enter it, or travel into it from another plane of existence, such as the Astral or Ethereal Plane. The spell's area can't overlap with another <em>forbiddance</em> spell.</p><p>The spell damages specific types of trespassing creatures. Choose one or more of celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature first enters the area on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell). You may designate a password. A creature speaking this password as it enters takes no damage from the spell.</p><p>After casting this spell on the same area for 30 consecutive days it becomes permanent until dispelled. This final casting to make the spell permanent consumes its material components.</p>",
