On a success, you unlock or open the target with a loud metallic clanging noise easily audible at up to 300 feet. In addition, any traps on the object are automatically triggered. An item with multiple locks requires multiple castings of this spell to be opened.</p><p>When you target an object held shut by an arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, allowing the object to be opened and shut normally during that time.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The level of the arcane lock you can suppress increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd. In addition, if the level of your knock spell is 2 or more levels higher than that of the arcane lock, you may dispel the arcane lock instead of suppressing it.</p>",
