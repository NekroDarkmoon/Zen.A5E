The message may take up to 10 minutes to convey.</p><p>When your trigger condition is met, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in the same voice and volume as you used when instructing it. If the object chosen has a mouth (for example, a painted portrait) this is where the mouth appears.</p><p>You may choose upon casting whether the message is a single event, or whether it repeats every time the trigger condition is met.</p><p>The trigger condition must be based upon audio or visual cues within 30 feet of the object, and may be highly detailed or as broad as you choose.</p><p>For example, the trigger could be when any attack action is made within range, or when the first spring shoot breaks ground within range.</p>",
