At the same time, an illusory copy of you appears where you're standing.</p><p>This invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.</p><p>You can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you'd like.</p><p>You may see and hear through your copy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to switch between your copy's senses and your own, or back again. While using your copy's senses you are blind and deaf to your body's surroundings.</p><p>The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it.</p>",
