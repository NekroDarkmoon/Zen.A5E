The spell ends early if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end this spell early on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a spell slot of 5th- or 6th-level, the damage increases to 5d8.</p><p>When using a spell slot of 7th- or 8th-level, the damage increases to 6d8.
