The sphere can be destroyed without harming anyone inside by being dealt at least 15 force damage at once or by being targeted with a dispel magic spell cast using a 4th-level or higher spell slot. The sphere is immune to all other damage, and no spell effects, physical objects, or anything else can pass through, though a target can breathe while inside it. The target cannot be damaged by any attacks or effects originating from outside the sphere, and the target cannot damage anything outside of it.</p><p>The target can use an action to roll the sphere at half its Speed. Similarly, the sphere can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>",
