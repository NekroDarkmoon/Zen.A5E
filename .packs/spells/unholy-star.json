The spell fails if you can't see the point where the meteor explodes.</p><p>Each creature within range that can see the meteor (other than you) makes a Dexterity saving throw or is blinded until the end of your next turn. Fiery chunks of the meteor then plummet to the ground at different areas you choose within range. Each creature in an area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in more than one area is affected only once.</p><p>The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.</p>",
