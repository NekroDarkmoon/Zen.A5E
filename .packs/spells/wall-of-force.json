    "description": "<p>You create an invisible wall of force at a point you choose. The wall is a horizontal or vertical barrier, or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1/4 inch thick.</p><p>If the wall enters a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape. Any creature without a special sense like blindsight has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall.</p><p>It can be destroyed with dispel magic cast using a spell slot of at least 5th-level or by being dealt at least 25 force damage at once. It is otherwise immune to damage. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through it.</p>",
