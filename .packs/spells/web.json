If you don't the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends.</p><p>Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.</p><p>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).</p><p>A creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.</p><p>Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon a giant wolf spider in an unoccupied space within the web's area. When using a 6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders.</p><p>When using a 7th-level spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a group, which have their own turns. The spiders obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web's area.</p>",
