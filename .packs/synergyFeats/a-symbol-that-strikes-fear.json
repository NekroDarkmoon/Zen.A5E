Creatures with a CR lower than your alter egoâ€™s Prestige rating are frightened of you while you are in your alter ego.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">In addition, you become particularly adept at subduing your enemies rather than outright killing them. Whenever you begin a turn grappling a creature, you can attempt to non-lethally subdue it. The grappled creature makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature is knocked unconscious for the next hour. A creature with more than 25% of its maximum hit points automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p>",
