You gain immunity against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from weapons that are not magical or silvered.</p><p><strong>Full Moon Ferocity</strong>. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a tusks attack, you regain your use of the Relentless feature. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
