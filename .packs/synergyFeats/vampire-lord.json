You can’t use reactions or speak. Otherwise, you use your statistics. Any items you are carrying transform with you.</p><p>While transformed into a mist, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, can’t speak, can’t take actions or manipulate objects, are immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and have advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks.
