When a creature other than you or your allies enters a fury aura or starts its turn there it makes a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes confused, except instead of rolling to determine their actions as normal for the confused condition, they are always considered to have rolled the 7 or 8 result. At the end of each of a confused creatureâ€™s turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to it for the remainder of your rage.</p>",
